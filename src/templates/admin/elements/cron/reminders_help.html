<p>Currently active Review and Revision reminders are listed below. You can
    edit, delete or create new reminders from this interface. There are three
    types of reminder email supported by Janeway:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Review (Invited)</strong> - sent when a reviewer has been
        invited but not accepted a review request.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Review (Accepted)</strong> - sent when a reviewer has accepted
        a review request but not yet completed it.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Revision</strong> - Sent to authors with active revision requests.</li>
</ul>
<p>Review reminders, both invited and accepted, are sent based on the review assignment due date set by the editor. Revision reminders are sent based on the revision request due date set by the editor. You can set reminders to be sent either before or after the set due date.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you not create too many reminders for peer
    reviewers.</p>
