v1.5.0 Torres
-------------
Upgrade Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run this upgrade, you can use Janeway's built-in script (.update.sh).

On this version of Janeway we have bumped the version of Django from 1.11 to the most recent LTS version 3.2. As a result of multiple
backwards changes, there have been a lot of rewrites of old code involved. Any installed plugins do need to be updated for compatibility
with this new release as well, so we recommend upgrading your plugins first, before running the .update.sh script

v1.4.2
------

Upgrade Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you intend on enabling full-text search, see the specific notes about this feature below prior to upgrading.

The ``upgrade.sh`` script should then cover the usual upgrade procedure.

Since this release includes a fix for the sitemaps, we recommend re-generating them with ``python src/manage.py generate_sitemaps``
as documented in https://janeway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/robotsandsitemaps.html#sitemaps after the upgrade is completed.


Full-text Search
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This version of Janeway includes built-in support for full-text search. There is a feature flag controlling if this new feature should be enabled for an entire installation.

If you intend on enabling this feature, we recommend setting the following variables in your `settings.py`:

`ENABLE_FULL_TEXT_SEARCH = True`

For installations running PostgreSQL, it is also recommended to enable the following setting:
`CORE_FILETEXT_MODEL = "core.PGFileText"` (More details at https://janeway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#full-text-search )


OIDC
^^^^
Janeway now supports authentication via OIDC. If you would like to enable this new authentication system, we recommend having a look at the configuration instructions in the documentation:
https://janeway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oidc.html

v1.4.1
------
Version 1.4.1 introduces repositories, the brand-new repository system for Janeway.

Upgrade notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With this release of Janeway, there are a couple of new commands to generate the `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` endpoints.

After running the upgrade script `upgrade.sh`, you should run `python src/manage.py generate_robots` and `python src/manage.py generate_sitemaps`.

Sitemaps will be regenerated on a daily basis as per the configuration of the cron tasks installed by Janeway.

v1.4
----
Version 1.4 makes a move from HVAD to ModelTranslations as well as some bugfixes and improvements.

ModelTranslations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Janeway now uses ModelTranslations to store translated settings and metadata. The setting `USE_I18N` must be set to `True` in settings.py otherwise settings may not be returned properly.

1.4 has support for:

* News
* Pages
* Navigation
* Sections
* Editorial Groups
* Contacts
* Journals
* Article (limited to Editors only, title and abstract)

Support for Welsh (Cymraeg) is included. Support for German, French, Spanish and Italian is coming soon.

General
^^^^^^^
* The backend has been updated to use the Open Sans font.
* The default theme has been removed from core and now has its own repo (https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway/issues/1895)
* The clean theme is now part of core (https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway/issues/1896)
* All themes have a language switcher when this setting is enabled (https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway/issues/2159)
* When an Issue number is 0 it will no longer be displayed (https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway/pull/2338)
* The register page has been updated to make it clear you're registering for a press wide account (https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway/issues/2390)
