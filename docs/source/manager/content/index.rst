The URL for the page will be generated with these parts:

- Your journal's domain name (e.g. orbit.openlibhums.org)
- The path element “site” (a namespace for custom pages)
- The path you entered in the **Link** field.

An example: https://orbit.openlibhums.org/site/privacy

Edit a Page
~~~~~~~~~~~
From the Content page you can see a list of the pages currently on your journal. Select Edit to make changes.

Delete a Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To delete a page use the red Delete button.

.. warning::
   Data cannot be recovered so ensure you really want to remove a page before pressing the delete button.

Navigation
~~~~~~~~~~
The nav bar is made up of two kinds of items:

- Fixed nav elements that you can turn on or off
- Custom nav items that you can create and modify

Fixed nav elements include:

- Home
- News
- Articles
- Issues
- Collections

To add a new custom nav item, from the content manager page, select "Edit Nav" and fill in the fields as desired. Details of how each field works are displayed below the field.

Footer Navigation
-----------------
With some themes, you can put a navigation link in the footer rather than the top navigation bar.

Use **For footer** to switch the link to the footer. At the press level, only the path theme support this feature so far.

Press managers can also create custom footer links that extend to all journal websites, such as for publisher policies.

To do so, create a navigation item and check **Is external**, **For footer**, and **Extend to journals**.

The Editorial Team interface is relatively complex and is made up of:

- Editorial Groups

When you access the interface the form for making a new group is displayed on the right of the page and the existing groups listed on the left. For each group you can:

- Edit the membership
- Edit the group details
- Delete the group
- Drag and drop to re-order them

.. tip::
   As of version 1.4 the Group description field supports HTML and presents a rich-text editor. If you do not wish to add an account for each user you can simply list them in the rich text box using, for example, a bulleted list.

Adding a New Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Creating a new group allows you to add members and display them on the Editorial Team page. Each group is headed by the group name you supply.

- Name
    - The group name e.g. Editoral Team or Advisors
- Description
    - Displayed under the Name header on the Editorial Team page
- Sequence
    - The order the groups should be displayed, you can reorder the groups by editing their sequence or by dragging and dropping their record
    
Adding Members to a Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For an existing or newley created group you can use the Edit Members button (Green with a group of outlines) to change the membership of the group.

.. figure:: ../../nstatic/group_membership.png

On the left is a list of the current members, you can:

- Delete a member from the group
- Reorder the members by dragging and dropping a listing

Journal users are listed on the right and you can add a user to the group using the *Add* button. If a user account does not exist for the user you can use the *Add New User* button to add them.

Submission Page Items
---------------------
A new addition to v1.4 the Submission Page Items system lets you totally customise the Submission page to your liking. The existing submission items have automatically been setup for you and can now be edited.

.. figure:: ../../nstatic/submission_items.png

    List of default submission items generated in the v1.4 upgrade process.

You can manage submission items in three ways:

- Link to a setting
- Custom HTML
- Special Display

From the main screen you can add new, edit existing and delete items as well as re-order them by dragging and dropping rows of the table.

Link to a Setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can opt to link a submission item to an existing setting so it will display the same content as that setting. This is currently used for the majority of the automatically generated submission page items. Some examples of this are:

- About
- Focus and Scope
- Submission Checklist

You can tell when a submission item is linked to a setting under the 'Setting or Text' column in the main table or the 'Existing setting' field being completed when editing a submission item.


Custom HTML
~~~~~~~~~~~

A submission item can also just have some custom HTML, you can fill out the 'Text' rich text box. When using the Text field you should not select an Existing Setting or this will take precedence when the page is rendered.

Special Display
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Special Display settings are used to display Licenses and Sections on the Submission page. To add these blocks you need to set the title of the item to either:

- licenses

or

- sections

You must also leave 'Text' and 'Existing setting' blank. This will render a special template that displays all publicly available sections or licenses.

Media Files
^^^^^^^^^^^
The Media Files manager lets editors upload and host small files. Examples include:

* Author Guidelines
* Proofing Guidelines
* Article Submission Templates

Once a file is uploaded a link is provided that you can then insert into CMS pages or templates.

.. note::
    The Media Files section should not be used to upload videos unless you have sufficient storage space/bandwidth. If you use Janeway Hosting you should contact the support team.

Copy-Paste and Rich Text Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When working on webpages, news items, and other fields such as abstracts,
many people copy and paste from a word processor into Janeway. As of
version 1.5.1, Janeway handles this better than before: When a user attempts
to paste text that carries over styling from another application, Janeway
will prompt the user to ask if they want to retain the formatting or paste as
plain text.

Additionally, Janeway will always remove any potentially harmful markup being
pasted in or typed using the code view across rich-text fields, such as scripts
that could lead to `Cross Site Scripting <https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/>`_ attacks.
